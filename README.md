# cmc_parser

A simple python script to scrap token name, url, hosting chain, ICO price, end date and goal price from [CoinMarketCap ICO Calendar](https://coinmarketcap.com/ico-calendar/ended/) html and parsing them into [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) DataFrames.

Simply loading other pages with url formatting doesn't work, so instead of investing my time on that issue, I just downloaded the pages via Firefox.
